Christmas card set in LaTeX with DJR’s [Warbler Text](https://djr.com/notes/warbler-text-font-of-the-month).

Based on my [2021 christmas card](https://github.com/Kamik423/christmas-card-2021) and my [2021 christmas card](https://github.com/Kamik423/christmas-card-2019).

## Background Image

Adapted from the title page of *Household stories from the collection of the Bros. Grimm* [on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/householdstories00grim/page/n7/mode/2up), no license given, presumably public domain.
Editing steps present in *background-creation/,* edited with macOS’s Preview.‍app, Acorn, Procreate, and Vectornator (now Linearity Curve).
Removed noise and text and edited out the big *H* on the left.

Originally I intended to make a stamp to print it and even got a prototype made, but eventually the time ran out to print it with my home inkjet printer.
